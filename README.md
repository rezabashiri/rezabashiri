- Hi, I’m @rezabashiri

👋 My experience and developing skills have been starting from primary school by doing a little bit of coding in Dos environment, I loved to learn how codes translate into machine language and how computers understand those.

That was the first motivation for me to come up with studying Information technology at university and find out the secrets behind those mysteries.

I tried to challenge myself anytime so I joined the soccer 3d robotic team at university to teach nao robots to stand up, walk, shoot and etcetera with Genetic algorithms and unsupervised learning methods of machine learning. During my studies and researches at university, I was starting to work with companies like IRISA to learn how to use my programming knowledge in industrial environments so my student time gave me a very strong knowledge and experience of programming and being a team member.

I began my professional career right after military service in the army, Asp.net and SQL server were the ones to develop many customers orders, but as technology go forward, I've been keeping myself updated on the latest technologies, after old asp.net, asp.net MVC, .net core, Reactjs, and docker have become my languages and technologies to work with. 

Streamliner of communication between stack holders and developing team, scrum master, project delivery management, Server setups, Kubernetes, Docker and Queues are the other experiences of mine
